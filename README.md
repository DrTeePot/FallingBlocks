FallingBlocks
=============

A game in which one avoids blocks falling randomly from the sky.

unfortunately the completed version of this project has been lost, as it was created before I started using version control and backups for all of my projects. 

### I made this game in highschool before I found out about version control. This is an early version of the game that I found on an old USB stick and barely works. Programming concepts are still evident in the source, but this is not even close to the finished project. I know, I'm as sad about it as you are (to 16 year old me, get GitHub).
